{
    game_information: Game(),
    team_stats: {
        home_team_stats = TeamStats(),
        away_team_stats = TeamStats()
    },
    player_stats: {
        home_player_stats = [PlayerStats],
        away_player_stats = [PlayerStats]
    }
}


### NEXT STEPS
- move to player parsing
- update scrapy pipeline
- update pipeline -> DB mapping


#combining basic box and advanced box stats for players
basic_box returns dict of player Stats
{
    "player1": {PLAYER INFO AND ALL THEIR STATS},
    ...
}
advanced_box returns same 
{
    "player1": {ALL OTHER STATS},
    ...
}

for key in basic_box.keys():
    out_dict = basic[key].update(advanced[key])
    out_list.append(out_dict)
