- Get Game Ids -> url https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/?month=XX&day=XX&year=XXXX
    - <p class="links"> <a href = "/boxscores/YYYYMMDDTTT.html">

{
    game_information: Game(),
    team_stats: {
        home_team_stats = TeamStats(),
        away_team_stats = TeamStats()
    },
    player_stats: {
        home_player_stats = [PlayerStats],
        away_player_stats = [PlayerStats]
    }
}
